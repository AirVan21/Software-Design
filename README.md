# Software Design Course in SPbAU
  
    Implementation of simple command line interpreter
---
## Installation steps:

    1. Clone repo
    2. Open project in Intellij IDEA
    3. Install ANTLR v4 grammar plugin https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7358
    4. Open ShellGrammar.g4 file (grammar file)
    5. Configure ANTLRv4 (right click menu)
    6. Choose "generate parse tree visitor"
    7. Generate ANTLRv4 classes (Ctrl + Shift + G)
    8. Mark "gen" folder as "Generated Sources Root"
## Testing:

Run ```mvn install``` in root directory

## Supported funtionality:
   * cat
   * echo
   * wc
   * pwd
   * exit
   * key = value (environment variables)
   * $ and |
   * full and weak quoting

## Architecture:

![UML Class Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AirVan21/Software-Design/shell/Commands/diagram/ClassDiagram.png)


   Shell class is a main class which implements REPL functionality. After user input Shell class constructs ANTLRv4       ParseTree via Parser class for handled input and runs visiting ParseTree using ShellVisitor class. Shell visitor class gets Storage class for result-saving logic (Storage class is unique per input line) and Shell visitor creates Environment class (for storing environment variables) for a whole REPL session. CommandVisitor's successors are visited (if needed) and line exectution result is stored in Storage class.
